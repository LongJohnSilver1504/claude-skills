# React Clean Architecture Principles

## Overview

This skill provides the **principles and decision-making framework** for building maintainable React applications. It answers WHEN and WHY to structure code, while `create-feature` provides the HOW.

**Core philosophy:** Structure exists to manage change. Good architecture makes future changes easy; bad architecture makes them expensive.

| `prd-to-ux` | UX foundations before building |
| `frontend-testing` | Testing the structured code |

## The First Draft Philosophy

### Start Working, Then Structure

Don't design upfront. Get something on screen first.

```tsx
// ✅ First draft: Everything in one component
export default function PromptPage() {
  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/prompts/active')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setPrompt)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{prompt?.title}</h1>
      {prompt?.answered ? (
        prompt.answers.map(a => <div key={a.id}>{a.text}</div>)
      ) : (
        <form>...</form>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is fine for:
- Validating an idea
- Prototyping UI
- Exploring new technology
- Pre-demo crunch

**When to stop and structure:** When the first draft works and you're not in prototype mode.

### The Editing Mindset

Think of code like writing:
1. **First draft** - Get it working, ignore structure
2. **Editing** - Apply principles, extract layers
3. **Ship** - Clean, maintainable code

Don't skip step 1. Don't skip step 2.

## Layer Separation

### The Three Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           PRESENTATION LAYER            │
│  Components, JSX, event handlers        │
│  "What to render"                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER          │
│  Custom hooks, domain services          │
│  "What to do with data"                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           TRANSPORT LAYER               │
│  HTTP clients, API adapters             │
│  "How to get data"                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Layers Matter

Different layers change at different rates:
- **Transport** changes rarely (API endpoints are stable)
- **Business logic** changes sometimes (new features, rules)
- **Presentation** changes often (UI tweaks, styling)

When layers are mixed, a simple UI change requires understanding HTTP logic. When separated, changes stay contained.

### Layer Rules

| Layer | Can Import From | Never Imports |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Transport (`api/`) | Domain schemas | React, hooks, components |
| Business Logic (`hooks/`, `domain/`) | Transport, domain | Components |
| Presentation (`components/`) | Hooks, domain services | Transport directly |

```tsx
// ❌ Component importing transport layer
import { axios } from 'axios'

const PaymentCard = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/payments').then(...)  // Layer violation
  }, [])
}

// ✅ Component using hook (which hides transport)
const PaymentCard = () => {
  const { data } = usePayments()  // Clean separation
}
```

## Deep vs Shallow Modules

### The Iceberg Principle

A **deep module** has a small API surface hiding large complexity (like an iceberg).

```tsx
// Deep module: Simple API, complex internals
const { prompt, handleSubmit } = usePrompt()

// Inside usePrompt: query client, mutations, caching, error handling,
// refetch logic, optimistic updates... all hidden
```

A **shallow module** exposes too much, hiding little.

```tsx
// Shallow module: Large API, simple internals
const {
  data,
  isLoading,
  isError,
  error,
  refetch,
  queryKey,
  queryFn,
  staleTime,
  ...
} = usePromptQuery()

// Just wraps useQuery with no added value
```

### When to Abstract

Create abstractions when they're **deep**:
- Hide 5+ lines of logic behind 1 function call
- Encapsulate decisions (caching, error handling)
- Provide domain-specific names (`usePrompt` not `useQueryWithConfig`)

Don't create abstractions when they're **shallow**:
- Just renaming existing functions
- Adding a layer that passes everything through
- Wrapping with no added behavior

---

## Guard Clauses

### Eliminate Nested Conditionals

Nested ternaries in JSX signal a component needs splitting.

```tsx
// ❌ Nested conditionals
return (
  <main>
    {prompt ? (
      prompt.answered ? (
        <AnswersList answers={prompt.answers} />
      ) : (
        <AnswerForm />
      )
    ) : (
      <LoadingQuote />
    )}
  </main>
)

// ✅ Guard clause pattern
if (!prompt) {
  return <LoadingQuote />
}

return (
  <main>
    <PromptContent prompt={prompt} />
  </main>
)

// In PromptContent:
function PromptContent({ prompt }) {
  if (!prompt.answered) {
    return <AnswerForm />
  }
  return <AnswersList answers={prompt.answers} />
}
```

### Guard Clause Rules

1. **Check faulty state first** - Handle edge cases at the top
2. **Return early** - Don't nest the happy path
3. **Invert conditions** - Use `if (!x)` not `if (x) { ... } else`

```tsx
// ❌ Else statement
function canRefund(payment) {
  if (payment.status === 'succeeded') {
    return Date.now() - payment.createdAt < REFUND_WINDOW
  } else {
    return false
  }
}

// ✅ Guard clause
function canRefund(payment) {
  if (payment.status !== 'succeeded') return false
  return Date.now() - payment.createdAt < REFUND_WINDOW
}
```

## Trust Boundary Validation

### Validate at the Edge

Validate data where it enters your application, not where it's used.

```tsx
// ❌ Validation in component
function AnswersList({ answers }) {
  if (!Array.isArray(answers)) return null
  if (!answers.every(a => a.text && a.author)) return null
  // Now render...
}

// ❌ Validation in hook
function usePrompt() {
  const { data } = useQuery(...)
  if (!data?.answers) return { prompt: null }
  // Check every field...
}

// ✅ Validation in transport layer
export function getActivePrompt() {
  const { data } = await client.get('/prompts/active')
  return promptSchema.parse(data)  // Zod validates here
}
```

### Why Edge Validation Works

1. **Single point of validation** - Don't repeat checks everywhere
2. **Fail fast** - Bad data caught immediately
3. **Type safety downstream** - After validation, types are guaranteed
4. **No runtime surprises** - Components never see malformed data

### TypeScript Casting is Not Validation

```tsx
// ❌ False security
const data = response.data as Prompt  // No runtime check

// ✅ Actual validation
const data = promptSchema.parse(response.data)  // Runtime + types
```

## Domain-Driven API Design

### Design for Access Patterns, Not REST Purity

Build APIs around what the UI needs, not generic REST conventions.

```
❌ RESTful purism:
GET /prompts                    → Get list
GET /prompts?active=true        → Get current ID
GET /prompts/:id                → Get prompt data
GET /prompts/:id/answers        → Get answers
GET /users/:id/answered/:promptId → Check if answered

= 5 requests, complex client logic

✅ Domain-driven:
GET /prompt/active              → Everything the page needs

= 1 request, simple client
```

### The Purism Trap

When APIs are too generic:
- **Frontend becomes the driver** - Business logic leaks to client
- **Overfetching** - Get data you won't use
- **Waterfall requests** - Wait for each response
- **Complexity migration** - Not eliminated, just moved

### Backend Decides What, Frontend Decides How

- **Backend:** What data to return, what's allowed
- **Frontend:** How to render, what to show

Don't build a generic API and force the frontend to assemble data.

---

## Component Responsibility (Principle)

Components are **pure renderers** — they receive data and return JSX. Logic, state, and side effects belong in hooks.

This skill covers the *why*. For the project-specific *how* (file structure, hook naming, wizard step patterns, dialog state naming), see your project's `component-hook-separation.md` rule.

---

## Hardcoded Value Extraction (Principle)

Hardcoded strings (routes, endpoints, query keys) drift into bugs when copy-pasted. Extract them to a single source of truth so the type system catches typos.

This skill covers the *why*. For project-specific extraction locations and patterns (where `links` lives, how endpoint constants are structured, query key conventions), see your project's `centralized-links.md` and `tanstack-query.md` rules.

---

## Extraction Triggers

### When to Extract

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Used 3+ times | Extract to shared location |
| 50+ lines in component | Split into sub-components |
| Nested conditional | Extract to child component |
| `useEffect` with fetch | Extract to custom hook |
| Data transformation | Move to hook or service |
| Business rule check | Move to domain service |

### When NOT to Extract

| Situation | Keep Inline |
|-----------|-------------|
| Used once | Don't premature-abstract |
| Simple ternary | Not every condition needs extraction |
| Short component | Don't split for the sake of splitting |
| Prototype code | Wait until patterns emerge |
| Thin wrapper | A div with className + children is not worth a component |

### Inline vs Extract: The Wrapper Test

A component is a **thin wrapper** if it:
- Has < 10 lines of JSX
- Has no hook or logic (just props → JSX)
- Adds only styling/layout (a `div` with `className`)
- Is used in exactly one place

**Thin wrappers should be inlined.** They add indirection without hiding complexity.

```tsx
// ❌ Thin wrapper — just a styled div
export const PageToolbar = ({ children, className }) => (
  <div className={cn('flex items-center gap-2 border-b px-4 py-2', className)}>
    {children}
  </div>
)

// ✅ Inline it in the parent
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 border-b border-border px-4 py-2">
  <BackButton href={backHref} />
  <CheckoutGuideDialog ... />
</div>
```

**Extract when:** the component has its own hook, manages state, or is used in 2+ places.

## Iterative Refinement Workflow

### The Cycle

```
1. FIRST DRAFT
   └─→ Get it working (ignore structure)
   
2. IDENTIFY ISSUES
   └─→ Too many responsibilities?
   └─→ Nested conditionals?
   └─→ Repeated patterns?
   
3. APPLY PRINCIPLES
   └─→ Extract layers
   └─→ Create hooks
   └─→ Add validation
   
4. VERIFY
   └─→ Each piece has single responsibility?
   └─→ Changes stay contained?
   └─→ Easy to test?
   
5. SHIP
```

### Questions to Ask

After first draft, ask:

1. **Responsibilities:** Does this component know too much?
2. **Layers:** Is transport mixed with presentation?
3. **Conditionals:** Are there nested ternaries?
4. **Validation:** Where does bad data get caught?
5. **Reuse:** What would I copy-paste for similar features?

---

## Anti-Patterns

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for detailed examples including:
- **Component Knows Too Much** -- mixing state, fetching, transforms, and business logic
- **Shallow Abstraction** -- wrappers that add no value vs deep modules
- **Validation in Wrong Place** -- scattered checks vs single boundary validation

---

## Mapping to create-feature Structure

See [references/layer-mapping.md](references/layer-mapping.md) for the detailed diagram mapping these 3 layers to the `create-feature` folder structure.
